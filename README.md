# RTM

RTM is a real time measurements platform that use `golang`, `mqtt`, `swagger` and `redis`.

## Usage

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

This command start two containers:
- Redis that store data (measurements and iata codes)
- Grafana that allow data-visualization on `localhost:3000`
- Mosquitto that run an MQTT broker that can be used with runners

### Install and launch agent runner

The agent runner allows to run a measurement agent directly in the cli. 

Install it by using this command: 

```sh
go get github.com/COMA-tor/rtm/agent/runner
go install github.com/COMA-tor/rtm/agent/runner
```

Now the runner is installed and can be used directly in the cli.

```sh
runner -help
```

> The runner directly output in stderr.

#### Runner configuration

The runner can be configured with a yaml config file.

```yaml
broker_host: localhost
broker_port: 1883
client_id: test
topic: /topic/test/
qos: 2
sensor_type: wind speed
sensor_unit: Â°C
```

> For now, `sensor_unit` is not used.

### Sensors

There is three sensor types:
- `temperature`
- `wind speed`
- `pressure`

## Possible improvements

- Handle reload signals in agent runner to reload the sensor and the agent
- Use `sensor_unit` in order to apply some computation and unify data
